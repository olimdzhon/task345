If the number of objects in the relationship do not satisfy `minCount` and `maxCount`, the transaction's commit (or auto-commit) would fail with a validation error.

         - parameter deleteRule: defines what happens to relationship when an object is deleted. Valid values are `.nullify`, `.cascade`, and `.delete`. Defaults to `.nullify`.

(Such a difference is important in cases where the properties are unchanged but the format or content of its data are changed.)
         - parameter renamingIdentifier: used to resolve naming conflicts between models. When creating an entity mapping between entities in two managed object models, a source entity property and a destination entity property that share the same identifier indicate that a property mapping should be configured to migrate from the source to the destination. If unset, the identifier will be the property's name.
