/**
 The `SetupResult` indicates the result of an asynchronous initialization of a persistent store.
 `SetupResult.success` indicates that the storage setup succeeded. The associated object for this `enum` value is the related `StorageInterface` instance.
 `SetupResult.failure` indicates that the storage setup failed. The associated object for this value is the related `CoreStoreError` enum value.
